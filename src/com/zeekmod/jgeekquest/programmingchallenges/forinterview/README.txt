- In language of choice, write a routine that reverses a string in place

- Now write a routine that reverses each word in a string
(words are characters separated by spaces)

- Now write a routine that reverses the order of words in a string

- Write a program to solve the TelegramProblem

- Write a program to solve the OddWordProblem

- Write a binary search routine that returns the first occurrence of the key

- If it is recursive, convert it to non-recursive, or vice-versa.

- Now write another that returns where the key should be inserted if it is missing

- Find the length of a linked list, or report that it has a loop

- Solve this with a fixed amount of additional storage

- Sort the linked list in place.

- Given a function f that takes a real and returns a real, find a value x such that f(x) is zero

- Find the longest monotone subsequence from an array of numbers. A sub-sequence is any X[j[1]], X[j[2]] ... X[j[k]] 
where the initial array is X[n], k<=n, 0<=j[i]<n, for all i:0<=i<n and j[i]<j[i+1] for all i: 0<= i < n-1

- Write a program that given the time of the day (hours, minutes) returns the angle between the hands on a clock.

- Be on the lookout for them asking if they should return just the smaller angle, and the "clever" solution that just outputs 0 because the hands are parallel.

- See AngleBetweenClockHands

- Write a function that will solve the leader election in a ring. All processes must run this same function and one and only one of them must be elected leader.
