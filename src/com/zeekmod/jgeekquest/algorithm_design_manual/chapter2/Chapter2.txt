Exercise 2.1) O((n^3)/3)


Exercise 2.3)

r = 0
for i = 1 to 10
	for j = 1 to [1, 2, 3...10]
		for [1, 2, 3...10] to [1 "i" = [1, 2, 3...10] "j"]	
			r = r + 1
			
			
Loop 1)
	n = 5
	
	for loop 1) for i = 1 to [1...10]
		for loop 2) for j = 1 to 1
			for loop 3) for k = 1 to 1
				for loop 4) for l = 1 to i+k-k = 1
					r=r+1 which is 1
					
	for loop 1) for i = 2 to 10
		for loop 2) for j = 1 to [1,2]
			for loop 3) for k = 2 to [1,2]
				for loop 4) for l = 1 to i+k-k = [1,2]
					r=r+1 which is 1
					
	Answer: f(n) = ((n(n+1)(2n+1))/6) + n(n+1)/2
